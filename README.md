# SimuSDN
A simulator for Software Defined Network Research (Based on OMNeT++)

SimuSDN provides a set of simulation models to integrate and simulate Software Defined Networking (SDN) into the OMNeT++ event based simulation framework. It consists of two main modules:-

1. OpenFlow switch
2. OpenFlow controller

Additionally, supporting modules (e.g., host) are provided to aid the simulation.

The main goal of SimuSDN is to provide an intuitive way to rapidly develop, simulate and test the core aspects of new SDN/OpenFlow protocols.
